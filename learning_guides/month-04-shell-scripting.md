   - Step-by-step debugging
   
4. **Testing Scripts**:
   - Creating test cases
   - Automating script testing
   - Handling edge cases and failures

### Week 2 Project
**Script Fortification**: Take an existing script from the project and enhance it with robust error handling, input validation, and logging.

## Week 3: Text Processing & Data Manipulation

### Daily Practice (20-30 minutes)
- Process a text file using shell commands
- Create one-liners for common text transformations
- Practice using regex for pattern matching

### Assignments
1. **Advanced Text Processing**:
   - Read TLCL Chapters 31-33
   - Master grep with regular expressions
   - Learn advanced sed patterns and commands
   
2. **Data Extraction and Transformation**:
   - Parse structured text (CSV, JSON)
   - Extract specific fields with awk
   - Transform data between formats
   
3. **File System Operations**:
   - Batch processing with find and xargs
   - Recursive operations
   - Safe file handling practices
   
4. **Text Analysis**:
   - Word/line counting and statistics
   - Comparing files (diff, comm)
   - Sorting and uniqueness

### Week 3 Project
**Log Analyzer**: Create a script that processes log files, extracts meaningful information, and generates summary reports.

## Week 4: Workflow Automation

### Daily Practice (20-30 minutes)
- Identify and automate a repetitive task
- Integrate scripts with your daily workflow
- Measure time saved through automation

### Assignments
1. **Development Process Automation**:
   - Read TLCL Chapters 34-36
   - Create scripts for project setup/teardown
   - Automate routine development tasks
   
2. **Integration with Other Tools**:
   - Combine shell scripts with Neovim and Tmux
   - Automate Git workflows
   - Create project-specific automation
   
3. **Task Scheduling**:
   - Learn cron for scheduled tasks
   - Create maintenance scripts
   - Understand background processes
   
4. **Building Interactive Scripts**:
   - Command-line user interfaces
   - Menu-driven scripts
   - Progress indicators and user feedback

### Week 4 Project
**Developer Dashboard**: Create an interactive command-line dashboard that provides quick access to your most common development tasks and project information.

## Month 4 Project: Automation Suite

**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive suite of shell scripts that automate your development workflow and increase productivity.

**Requirements**:
1. At least 5 scripts that automate different aspects of your workflow
2. Documentation for each script with usage examples
3. A central script that provides access to all tools
4. Proper error handling and user feedback
5. Measurable improvement in your workflow efficiency

**Deliverables**:
- Collection of shell scripts with comments
- Documentation explaining each script's purpose and usage
- Installation script to set up your automation suite
- Usage statistics showing time saved (before/after comparison)

## Assessment Criteria
- Script functionality and reliability
- Code organization and readability
- Error handling robustness
- Documentation quality
- Measurable productivity improvement

## Suggested Daily Routine
1. 10 minutes reviewing shell scripting concepts
2. 15 minutes identifying automation opportunities
3. 20-30 minutes writing or refining scripts
4. 5 minutes measuring the impact of your automation
